# Archimedes NTUA ECE 2024 SaaS Project

## Overview
**Archimedes** is an online platform designed to provide problem solving capabilities for users. The application is structured as a set of microservices, where each service is responsible for a specific task. These services communicate with each other via well-defined APIs, typically using HTTP or messaging queues. Docker containers are used to encapsulate each service, ensuring they run consistently across different environments.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
    ````bash
    git clone https://github.com/ntua/saas2024-31
    cd saas2024-31
    ````
2. Ensure you have the following installed: 
	- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) 
	- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (if applicable)
3.	 Build the image and run the services
		```bash
		docker-compose up -d --build
		```
Now you should be able to access the web application through [localhost](http://127.0.0.1/).
